Color palettes
==============

Every project needs a minimum of one color palette in `yourprojet/estilo/palettes` folder. This files are simple *yaml* list of the hexadecimal colors you are going to use in your colorschemes and status lines.

You can write as many palettes as you want. This is a simple example of one:

```yaml
lemon: '#ffcc55'
grass: '#99bb00'
ocean: '#66bbff'
blood: '#ee2244'
text: '#eeeeee'
bg: '#282828'
```
